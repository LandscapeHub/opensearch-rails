The process for contributing is:

1. It is best to do your work in a separate Git branch. This makes it easier to synchronise your changes with [`rebase`](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2013/02/merge-vs-rebase/).

2. Make sure your changes don't break any existing tests, and that you add tests for both bugfixes and new functionality.

3. Submit a pull request.
Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and submit a pull request. In the pull request, describe what your changes do and mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken place, eg “Closes #123″.
